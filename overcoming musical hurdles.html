}

/* Tips for sidebar1:
1. since we are working in percentages, it's best not to use padding on the sidebar. It will be added to the width for standards compliant browsers creating an unknown actual width. 
2. Space between the side of the div and the elements within it can be created by placing a left and right margin on those elements as seen in the ".twoColLiqLtHdr #sidebar1 p" rule.
3. Since Explorer calculates widths after the parent element is rendered, you may occasionally run into unexplained bugs with percentage-based columns. If you need more predictable results, you may choose to change to pixel sized columns.

	margin-left: 10px; /* the left and right margin should be given to every element that will be placed in the side columns */

}

/* Tips for mainContent:
1. the space between the mainContent and sidebar1 is created with the left margin on the mainContent div.  No matter how much content the sidebar1 div contains, the column space will remain. You can remove this left margin if you want the #mainContent div's text to fill the #sidebar1 space when the content in #sidebar1 ends.
2. to avoid float drop at a supported minimum 800 x 600 resolution, elements within the mainContent div should be 430px or smaller (this includes images).
3. in the Internet Explorer Conditional Comment below, the zoom property is used to give the mainContent "hasLayout." This avoids several IE-specific bugs.

    <h1><span class="style10">OVERCOMING MUSICAL HURDLES</span></h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="style8">THE PROBLEM WITH LOUD  MUSIC</span></p>
    <p><span class="style5">Loud music can hurt your ears at times.Â Hearing loss means someone can't hear as well as other people do. For  some people, that means not being able to hear at all.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style5">If the noise around you is so loud that you  have to shout to be heard, there is a chance that the mechanism inside your ear  can be injured. Temporary hearing  loss can happen after you've been exposed to loud noise for any  duration. If you have temporary hearing loss, you won't be able to hear as well  as you normally do for a while.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style5">You also could have tinnitus which  is a medical term for ringing in the ears. Your ears can feel &quot;full,&quot;  too. Although your hearing frequently returns to normal, the dangerous part is  that you can lose it permanently if you listen to loud noise or music over and  over again.</span></p>
    <p><span class="style5">If someone is exposed to loud noise over a  long period of time, like every day, permanent  hearing loss can occur. This means the person's hearing won't  ever be as good as it once was. That's why construction workers and factory  workers need to wear ear protection. Lawn mowers and power tools, like  chainsaws, also can be loud enough to affect someone's ability to hear  high-pitched noises. This kind of noise also can cause a person to have  tinnitus all the time.</span></p>
    <p class="style5">Listening to loud music a lot can cause the  same kind of damage, especially if headphones are used. Some famous musicians  have suffered hearing loss and developed tinnitus â a real problem for someone  who needs to hear to make and enjoy music. That's why now you might notice that  some of your favorite musicians wear hearing protection while they're playing.</p>
    <p class="style5">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style8">HOW TO OVERCOME HEARING PROBLEMS?</p>
    <p class="style5">You can help keep your hearing in tip-top  shape.Protect your ears by <img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ7gBGEuYIOQBZTQA1-l1LFRm7U1MbiTOkI3Cg9SAxOUmqJYggZ" alt="" name="rg_hi" width="218" height="226" align="right" id="rg_hi" data-width="218" data-height="211" />wearing ear protection when you're using machinery,  like in metal shop at school. Also remember to turn down the volume, especially  when you're wearing headphones or in the car. You also might want to give your  ears a rest once in a while if you like wearing headphones.<br />
    And if you're going to a concert, consider  wearing earplugs to protect your ears from the boom, boom, boom! In fact,  special earplugs can be made for you if you're going to concerts a lot or if  you're a musician yourself.</p>
    <p class="style5">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style7">DOES MUSIC AFFECT LEARNING OF STUDENTS?</p>
    <p class="style5">Yes music greatly affects  the learning of all people. Without getting too technical the predisposition of  the brain for learning depends heavily on the brain wave patterns, Alpha and  Beta waves. Music is believed to be a stimulant for the production of Alpha  waves which are activated when the brain is in a non stressed state. Alpha wave  activity in the brain permits the chemical encoding of information to occur in  a context that the brain recognizes as beneficial. This is in direct opposition  to Beta wave activity that is generally stress based where the brain acts on  the limited information or stimuli it receives to react to the stimuli. </p>
    <p class="style5">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style7">OVERCOMING MUSICAL PROBLEMS WHICH AFFECT STUDIES </p>
    <p class="style6"><em><strong>The optimal choice for music in a  learning environment is wordless music with a non-descript melody performed at  60 beats per minute. <br />
